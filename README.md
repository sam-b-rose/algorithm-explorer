# Algorithm Explorer

This framework for business users or aspiring data scientists explores machine learning techniques top down. It is designed to provide a clear overview on data science techniques and introduce the reader to a foundation of machine learning algorithms.

The user begins by selecting the type of problem they are trying to solve. They are then navigated to an introduction on the types of techniques that can be used to solve that problem before being offered more information on the algorithms themselves.

The framework also includes examples, pros and cons for the different algorithms.
